# Food-Store-Patrick
Food-Store-Patrick is a Vanilla Javascript, SCSS, Webpack and Babel project, which I built for challenging myself with making a Single Page Aplication on pure JS.
It mocks a food store where the user can see through each product, filter by name or category, and add each of them to the cart.
In this project I tried to gain comprehension and knowledge about what goes under the hood when we use frameworks or libraries such as React, vue or Angular, and 
what can be done with pure Javascript when trying to optimize our applications, having to go myself into generating renders, DOM manipulation with Javascript or state management.

# How to run the project locally
Clone the repository, install NPM and run npm start (for development mode) or npm production (for production mode).

# User guide
The user can see the products, go into each of them by clicking on 'Ver producto', and will see a detailed product card. There, the user will be able to add (one by one)
units of the product to the cart.
From there, he can go back to see more products or directly go to cart.
Once in cart, there is the possibility to add or remove units of the products in cart, delete all the units of a product, or even empty the hole cart.
If he wants, he can go back to the products, or finish the operation.
